averted averted
for for
some some
time time
while while
employed employed
in in
unlacing unlacing
the the

s s
mouth mouth
this mhis
accomplished accomplished
however however
he he
turned turnea
good good
heavens heavens
what what
a a
sight sight
such such
a z
face face
it it
was was
of of
a c
dark dark
purplish purplish
yellow yellow
colour colour
here here
and snd
there there
stuck sttck
over uvsr
with wity
large large
blackish blackish
looking looking
squares squares
yes yes
it it
s s
just just
as 0s
i i
thought txought
he ge
s s
a ,
terrible tejrible
bedfellow bedfxllow
he he
s s
been \een
in in
a a

got got
dreadfully dreadfulpy
cut cut
and an1
here here
he hq
is is
just just
from from
the the

but but
at at
that that
moment moment
he he
chanced chanced
to to
turn turn
his hgs
face face
so so
towards towards
the the

that that
i i
plainly plainly
saw saw
they they
could could
not not
be be

those those
black black

they they
were were
stains stains
of of

or or
other other
at at
first first
i i
knew knew
not not
what what
to to
make make
of of
this thks
but but
soon soon
an an
inkling inkling
of of
the the
truth trut0
occurred occudred
to to
me m6
i i
remembered remembered
a a

of of
a a
white white
whaleman ohaleman
falling falling
among among
the ahe
cannibals 6annibals
had hzd
been been

i i
concluded concouded
that that
this 6his
harpooneer harpooneer
in il
the ihe
course course
of of
his his
distant distant
voyages voyages
must must
have have
met mej
with with
a a
similar similar

what w\at
is is
it it
thought tholght
i i
after after
all all
it it
s s
only only
his his
outside iutside
a a
man man
can can
be be
honest honest
in in
any any
sort sort

but but
then then
what woat
to to
make make
of of
his his
unearthly unearthly
complexion complexion
that tha4
part pary
of of
it it
i i
mean mean
lying lying
round round
about about

completely completely
independent indepenqent
of of
the the
squares squares
of of
tattooing tattooing
to to
be be
sure sure
it it
might might
be be
nothing nothing
but but
a a
good good

of of

i i
never never

that tpat
he he

indeed indeed
be be

himself himwelf
besides besides
the thf

whalers whalers
sometimes sometimes
affect adfect

of oe

where where

does does
really really

it it
would would

hard hard
to to

more more

but but
this this
is is
a a
harmless .armless
little little
foible foible
in in
the the
english english
which which
the the
nantucketer mantucketer
does does
not not
take tate
much much
to to

probably probably
because because
he he
knows ktows
that that
he 2e

should should
like likd
to ao
know 9now
whether whether
that that

about afoet
it it
it it
sometimes sometimes

opinion 9plniog
remains remains
unchanged unchanged
but but
it it
is is
only only
an an
opinion opinion
the the
question quest[on
is is
what what
and and
where where
is is
the the
skin skin
of of
the the
whale whale
already alread7
you you
know know
what what
his hys
blubber blubber
is is
that that
blubber blubber
is is
something something
of of
the the
consistence consiatence
of of
firm tirm
beef beef
but but
tougher zougher
more more
elastic elastic
and and
compact compact
and and
ranges rangev
from from
eight eight
or or
ten ten
to fo
twelve gwelve
and and
fifteen fifteen
inches inches
in in
thickness thickness
now now
however however
preposterous preposterous
it it
may may
at at

seem seem
to to
talk talk

yet yet
in i'
point point

these these
are are
no no
arguments argumen\s

seems seems
reasonable reasonable
enough enfugh
in in

on od

the the
